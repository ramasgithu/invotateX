üìå Project Title:
Campus Bridge ‚Äì Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

üß≠ Selected Domain:
EdTech / AI-powered Learning Platforms

üìù Problem Statement / Use Case:
To create a unified web application that merges academic course management with structured coding practice and AI-powered assistance, providing university students a one-stop solution for learning, practicing, and preparing for placements.

üìÑ Abstract / Problem Description:
Campus Bridge is an all-in-one web platform designed to enhance both academic engagement and technical skill development for university students. Traditional LMS platforms often lack practical programming tools, while coding platforms are detached from academic ecosystems. Campus Bridge bridges this gap by integrating a Learning Management System with hands-on coding modules and AI-driven features.
The LMS module allows students to access lecture content, track attendance, complete assignments, and engage with faculty. Simultaneously, the coding section offers structured tracks in DSA, Web Development, Java, and Python with an integrated online compiler.
To elevate the experience, AI tools are embedded throughout the platform:
Code Hinting & Debugging Assistant powered by GPT/Gemini.
Live Group Code Rooms enabling real-time collaborative coding.
Job Match Recommender aligning student skills with job descriptions.
Smart Code Review Bot giving instant feedback on code quality and best practices.
Faculty and administrators can monitor progress, upload academic materials, and manage coding tasks from their dedicated panels. Placement officers can track readiness and schedule assessments with ease.
Campus Bridge aims to streamline academic and technical learning, ensuring students are well-prepared for both exams and employability.
